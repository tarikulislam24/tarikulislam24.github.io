## About Me

I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology from the University of Rajshahi, bringing a strong foundation in genetics, molecular biology, and biotechnology to the table. My coursework and hands-on laboratory experience have equipped me with practical skills in genetic engineering techniques, DNA sequencing, and bioinformatics. I've also honed my abilities in research methodology, data analysis, and scientific writing.

My academic journey was enriched by active participation in diverse extracurricular activities and research projects. As a Junior Research Collaborator at ABCD Laboratory, Bangladesh, I specialized in Computer-Aided Drug Design, gaining valuable experience in project planning, execution, and analysis. This involvement, combined with my recognition as the Second Runner-up at the Dhaka South Region Biology Olympiad and a finalist in the Innovation Olympiad 1.0, underscores my problem-solving abilities, critical thinking skills, and capacity for innovative thought. I further demonstrated my expertise and negotiation prowess as the 2nd Runner-up at the Biotech-Notion Negotiation Challenge 2021, organized by the Network of Young Biotechnologists of Bangladesh (NYBB).

I hold student memberships with the British Society for Immunology, the American Society for Microbiology, and the Royal Society of Chemistry. My commitment to advancing the field extends to my volunteer roles, including serving as an Executive of Skill Development and Career Counseling at the Community of Biotechnology and a Campus Envoy for Red and White Innovations. I am eager to leverage my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact on society through the development of new technologies and treatments.
