## Research Interests

My primary research interests are in the fields of **Machine Learning**, **Data Science**, and **Natural Language Processing**. I am particularly fascinated by the potential of these technologies to solve complex problems and drive innovation across various domains.

I am currently exploring the following areas:

*   **Deep Learning:** Investigating neural network architectures for tasks such as image recognition and sentiment analysis.
*   **Reinforcement Learning:** Understanding how agents can learn to make optimal decisions in dynamic environments.
*   **Big Data Analytics:** Developing scalable solutions for processing and analyzing large datasets.

## Approach

I believe in a hands-on and iterative approach to research. I enjoy diving deep into the theoretical foundations of a topic and then applying that knowledge to practical projects. I am a strong advocate for open-source and collaborative research, and I am always eager to learn from and contribute to the broader academic community.
